### difference between int and bigint in sql?
<ins>**INT:**</ins> Typically, INT occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) of storage. int range is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.   
<ins>**BIGINT:**</ins> its use 8 bytes (64 bits) of storage.Bigint is like c++ long long it ranges from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

### What is normalization and denormalization?
Normalization	Denormalization
Goal:	Reduce redundancy and dependency.	  
Improve query performance.  
Process:	Organize data into smaller, related tables.	  
Introduce some redundancy to reduce joins.
Advantages:	Minimize data redundancy, ensure consistency. 	 
Faster query performance, simpler queries.
Disadvantages:	May lead to more tables, complex queries.	  
Increases data redundancy, maintenance complexity.
